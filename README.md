 Library app for the theOdinProject

 Made in HTML, CSS and JS. 
 Saves book cards in local storage.

 What I've learned: 
 - Using forms,
 - If you don't plan out the project, you'll have to rewrite it a lot,
 - How to use loops better,
 - Creating more complex HTML elements through JS,
 - Using objects in addition with arrays,
 - Using the 'data' attribute.
